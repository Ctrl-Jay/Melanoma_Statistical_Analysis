Melanoma Dataset Analysis

Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the melanoma dataset, which explores various aspects of the data including summary statistics, graphical summaries, regression analysis, correlation computations, t-tests for significance, and QQ-plots.

Data
The dataset consists of observations related to melanoma patients, with variables such as time, age, year, thickness, status, sex, and ulcer.

Analysis
Data Preprocessing
The dataset was loaded into R using the tidyverse library.
Categorical variables (status, sex, ulcer) were converted to factors.

Summary Statistics
Summary statistics were calculated for numerical variables before and after correction.
Categorical variables were summarized using bar plots.

Graphical Summaries
Histograms and boxplots were plotted for numerical variables (time, age, year, thickness).
Scatterplots were created to visualize relationships between age, thickness, and time.

Regression Analysis
Linear regression models were fitted to explore relationships between time, thickness, and age.
Coefficients and summaries of regression models were provided.

Correlation Computations
Correlation coefficients between time, thickness, and age were calculated.

T-tests for Significance
T-tests were conducted to determine the significance of differences in thickness, age, and time between genders.

QQ-Plots
QQ-plots were generated to assess the normality of thickness, age, and time distributions, grouped by gender.

Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the melanoma dataset, highlighting relationships between variables and differences across gender. Further analyses or modeling techniques could be applied depending on the specific research questions or objectives.
